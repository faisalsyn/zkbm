\section{Analysis of consensus cost}


\subsection{Round-trip time latency}
\note{display data we got from experiments (using ping for example) to get the distribution of RTTs. Maybe we should check with inter- and intra-datacenter communications. we discuss insights from the behavior of RTTs regarding their cost on consensus}
\note{ then we develop a model to describe RTTs, and develop a model to expect latency of getting all responses.}

\subsection{Consensus latency}
\note{ developa model to describe the latency of requests (such as the ones used for our baseline case, like zookeeper's paper). this will develop over previous section in addition to accounting the effect of service times in clients.}
