\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Coordination is essential for large-scale distributed applications. Handling the simplest operations in a distributed manner gave rise to unprecedented challenges. Different forms of coordination are used to handle a variety of tasks. Leader election and group membership is one way. Worrying about aspects of synchronization, concurrency, and distributed management is a huge burden on application developers. This is why many distributed coordinators were designed to be leveraged by those developers, such as ZooKeeper and Chubby. Other packages focus on one primitive, or aspect, of distributed coordination such as Amazon Simple Queue Service focusing on queueing.

Locks are a powerful coordination primitive. It guarantees mutual exclusion when accessing critical sources. However, it is also widely used to provide a mean of synchronization between distributed applications.
