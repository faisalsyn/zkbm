\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Coordination is essential for large-scale distributed applications. Handling the simplest operations in a distributed manner gave rise to unprecedented challenges. Different forms of coordination are used to handle a variety of tasks. Leader election and group membership is one way. Worrying about aspects of synchronization, concurrency, and distributed management is a huge burden on application developers. This is why many distributed coordinators were designed to be leveraged by those developers, such as ZooKeeper and Chubby. Other packages focus on one primitive, or aspect, of distributed coordination such as Amazon Simple Queue Service that focuses on queueing.

Locking is a powerful coordination primitive. It guarantees mutual exclusion when accessing critical sources. However, it is also widely used to provide a mean of synchronization between distributed applications. The choice of synchronization primitive is not an easy decision. Different applications have different characteristics. The amount of contention for example is cruicial on the choice of synchronization primitive and is highly dependent on the application type. The computing environment is of importance too. The latency of coordination and consensus have an effect on the performance of different primitives. The topic of synchronization protocols' pros and cons and comparison of both are widely studied in the literature of multiprocessors.

here is a need to reinvestigate synchronization protocols for large-scale distributed systems. In these systems communication latency can reach hundreds of milliseconds. This dramatic difference to the conventional multiprocessor environment might carry with it new revelations on the community's prejudice on synchronization protocols.
